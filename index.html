       <h1>The Utilization of Music in Film and Other Media</h1>
     </div>

      The use of different types of music in media has always been of interest to me.
      Music can dramatically change the tone of any movie, television show, or even video game it is utilized in.
      On this website I will include and analyze the use of music in different types of meida, how and how different types of music can
      convey different emotions and ideas, depending on the type of media it is used in.

    <h2>Music in Movies</h2>
    <p style="font-size:130%;">
      It is fascinating how much music can change the tone of a scene. Music can add so much emotion to a scene, as well as totally change
      the emotion of the scene in question. What I find most fascinating, however, is how the music in a scene can be utilized in so many
      different ways. For example, Avengers: Endgame (Spoilers!) uses a slow, romantic jazz song to set the tone of the final scene. This
      choice conveys a lot of emotion, instilling a sort of melancholy happiness in the viewer. It ends the intense, action-packed movie
      on a calm and happy scene that people have grown to love.

    <p style="font-size:130%;">
      While, in this scene, the music is used to convey joy, there have been many instances in media where very similar types of music are
      used to completely opposite ideas. For example, in the opening scene of "Watchmen", there is a brutal, bloody fight scene, in which one
      of the combatants is thrown out of a window to his death. The scene itself is quite brutal, but throughout the scene, "Unforgettable",
      by Nat King Cole is playing. This is a very similar song to the one that Steve and Peggy dance to at the end of Endgame, but the way it
      is used makes for some very interesting juxtaposition to the ruthless combat displayed onscreen, setting the tone for the movie very well.
      (I will not include the scene because of its brutality, but I will include the song and stills from the movie that capture its tone.)
