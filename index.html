      The use of different types of music in media has always been of interest to me.
      Music can dramatically change the tone of any movie, television show, or even video game it is utilized in.

      convey different emotions and ideas, depending on the type of media it is used in.

      different ways. For example, Avengers: Endgame (Spoilers!) uses a slow, romantic jazz song to set the tone of the final scene. This

      on a calm and happy scene that people have grown to love.
